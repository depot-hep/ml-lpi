Since in the seminar we used [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials) and its high-level API [Keras](https://keras.io/getting_started/), here we will suggest you to practise with another main library for Deep Learning - [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/). It provides tensor calculation with GPU support on the one hand, and automatic differentiation framework for flexibly and intuitively building various architectures on the other. We highly advise you to study both libraries (TensorFlow and PyTorch) in order to understand their similarities and differencies.
