# Machine Learning at Lebedev Physical Institute

This course has been designed to introduce the topic of Machine Learning (ML) to a High Energy Physics (HEP) audience. Although the common platform initially was the Lebedev Physical Institute (LPI), where its predecessor took place in the spring semester of 2019, the course's coverage is expanding. Currently, during the autumn semester of 2020 it is being taught to HEP students of MIPT and MEPhI, so the materials will be uploaded accordingly. For a more comprehensive overview and introduction to the topic, please have a look at the [kick-off lecture slides.](https://github.com/ml-lpi/ml-lpi/blob/master/Kick-off/Kick_off_lecture.pdf)

### Prerequisites
There is not much needed to start exploring things: basics of calculus, linear algebra, statistics and some understanding of programming (not necessarily Python). However, you still need to setup a few things to go ahead with coding, so please refer to [these instructions](https://www.notion.so/Getting-started-5c28a72ae7c84828a916d2644d084176) where we guide you through the essential process of preparing the coding environment.
